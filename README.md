For examples, look at the makefile and the examples directory.

The assembler is written in `c`, the vm is written in `rust`.

A WIP hardware implementation for the Sipeed Tang Nano 9k FPGA can be found in the `hardware` directory.
The corresponding repl/shell tool can be found in the `mutool` directory.
